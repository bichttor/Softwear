If youre doing front end stuff like html and css, those files will go in the static
  and templates folders.
  CSS and JS files should be in the stateic folder and HTML should be in the templates folder.
  The folders will be located in "src->main->resources"

Other java files should just be located in "src->main->java" 
  Ill create different packages for our files later. 

For the database, JPA/Hiberate is a simple way to use SQL without having write much SQL
  but if you want to write code, you can create a folder in the resource folder and call it
  database or sum "src->main->resources"

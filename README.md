### Project Methodology
This project was done using Scrum methodologies. We had a Scrum Master, Product Owner, Database Adminastrator, 2 front end developers, and 2 back end developers.  
Our process consisted of:  
- Submitting a proposal for professor review
- Developing project architecture and assigning roles
- Working in sprints to ensure deadlines are hit
- Presenting our product to the class
- Submitting a final report


### Architecture Design
**Monolithic Architecture Framework**  
Due to time constraints, simplicity of development, testing, and deployment, we have chosen to use a monolithic architecture framework where all functionalities will be consolidated within a codebase managed with Git. Core features interfacing with each other include the user interface layer, the dev interface layer, the business logic layer, and the database layer.  

**Core Features**
- Business Logic Layer (Product Catalog, Orders Service, User Registration)
- Customer UI/Admin Interface
- MySQL Database through AWS
